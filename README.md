# Spline Interpolation

This is a library for doing [cubic spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation) on one-dimensional data sets. It requires the data to be evenly spaced.

## Coming Soon
* Bicubic interpolation (for two-dimensional functions)
* More boundary condition options
